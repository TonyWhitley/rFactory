This is just a prototype.  Some things don't work and others
need extending.\n
See list of TBDs below.\n
\n
How it works \n
rFactory edits rFactor 2's data files before running it so rF2
thinks you selected the car/track etc. the last time you ran it.
To do this it needs data about the cars and tracks which
cannot always be obtained easily from rF2's data files.
Instead rFactory has its own data files filled with data
gleaned from rF2's data files then corrected and extended by
humans. That data is put in tables that you can filter and
order.  Once you have selected a car, track and other options
you can save it all as a "scenario".  (rFactory saves the
current scenario when you quit then reloads it next time.)\n
\n 
There is also favourites/rFactoryConfig.JSON where you can
change basic information about the path to rF2 and Steam.
And favourites/last.favouriteServersJSON where you can add
server names and their passwords to connect online
automatically.\n
\n 
It can also start "co-programs" such as Crew Chief or Discord.\n
\n
GOTCHAS: \n
If the track (or car, but that's less likely) data file does
not have a "Scene Description" entry (the name rF2 uses to
specify the track/car) then rFactory cannot set rF2 to use
it.\n
Note the 'Dummy_rF2' checkbox on the Options tab which is
used for debugging. 
Instead of running rF2 it just dumps what rF2 *would* do.\n
\n 
See the menu JSON editor/Help/FAQ for more on that.\n

TBDs\n
Not working:\n
* Opponent selection\n
* Reading servers and picking them\n
* Tweaking AI settings taking into account car and track\n
* Tweaking graphics settings taking into account car, track\n
    and other variables\n
Need extending\n
* Car selection of individual cars\n
* Track selection of individual tracks\n
Need improvement\n
* Car editor to use drop down selection for things like\n
    formula and gearbox\n
* Similarly for the track editor\n
* Improve the quality of extraction of car and track data\n
